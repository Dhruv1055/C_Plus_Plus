<p> Why I choose C++ ? </p>

C++ is a general-purpose programming language. This language is around 40 years old and has been a part of many software problems and projects.

----  C++ is an Efficient and Fast Language  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ is an advanced language that supports various programming methods like functional, procedural, and object-oriented programming. It is a fast language; its compile-time and execution time is faster than other programming languages. Some programming languages are also faster than C++. Still, like C++, they are not close to the machine code, as it is an intermediary language, so big organizations rely on C++ for fast speed with lesser resources.

----  Suitable for Big Projects  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ programming language is very well suited for big projects. Many projects, including compilers, cloud storage systems, databases, game development, graphic designs, etc., are built using C++. C++ is also used for making 3D visuals projects, these projects require control over huge amounts of data efficiently, and C++ is one of the best choices for that.

----  Community Support of C++ ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
C++ is an old language and is being studied and learned by most of the programmers around the globe, so it has huge community support. The large community of C++ means it will be easier and more flexible to learn this language. Community plays a very important role for a learner. If someone needs any help or guidance regarding C++, many programmers and experts are out there on different platforms creating resources for C++.

---- C++ Is Everywhere---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
C++ programming language is almost everywhere around the world. For example, it is used for making browsers, applications, and software. Also, C++ is used majorly to make operating systems, and almost all operating systems are built using C++, for example, Mac Os, Windows, Linux, etc.  

---- Versatility---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
C++ is around 40 years old language and is still one of the most popular languages; why is it so? C++ is versatile in nature and is a highly adaptable language. Due to high adaptability, it is still useful when it comes to software and developing games.
